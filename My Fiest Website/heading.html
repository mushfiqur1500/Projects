  researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext </p>

<p>system.Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and
  CERN data systems engineer Robert <small>Cailliau </small>collaborated on a <em>joint</em> request for
